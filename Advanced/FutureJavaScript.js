3. Transpile and Babel

Transpiling is the process of converting code written in one language to another language. In the context of JavaScript, this typically means converting code written in the latest version of the ECMAScript specification to a version of JavaScript that can be run in older browsers. Babel is a popular tool for transpiling JavaScript code. It can take code written in the latest version of ECMAScript and convert it to a version that can be run in older browsers.

4. Bundlers

Bundlers are tools that help you manage and optimize the code that you write for a web application. They take all of the JavaScript, CSS, and other assets that your application depends on, and combine them into a single file or set of files that can be served to users. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of HTTP requests that need to be made to the server.
