/* ----------------------------------------------------
1. What Is Testing And Why Is It Important

Testing is the process of verifying that a software application or system works correctly and meets the specified requirements. Is is important because it helps identify bugs and defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later on.
*/

// Example:
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = sum(2, 3);
console.log(result);
// Output: 5

/*
In this example, we have a sum function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. We then call this function with 2 and 3 as arguments, and print the result to the console. Testing this function ensures that it works correctly for all possible input values.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
2. Advanced Debugging

Advanced debugging techniques involve using tools and techniques to diagnose and fix more complex issues in a software application or system. This includes techniques like using a debugger, profiling tools, and log analysis.
*/

// Example:
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

debugger;
const newResult = multiply(2, 3);
console.log(newResult);
// Output: 6

/*
In this example, we use the debugger statement to pause the execution of the code at a specific point and inspect the variables and values in the current scope. This can be useful for diagnosing complex bugs and issues in a software application.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
3. Jest Basics

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that provides a range of features, including test runners, assertions, mocking, and snapshots. It is widely used for unit testing and has good support for modern JavaScript features.
*/

// Example:
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

/*
In this example, we use Jest to write a unit test for the sum function. We define a test case that expects the result of sum(2, 3) to be equal to 5. Jest will run this test and report any errors or failures.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
4. Types Of Tests

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that provides a range of features, including test runners, assertions, mocking, and snapshots. It is widely used for unit testing and has good support for modern JavaScript features.
*/

// Example:
// Unit test example
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

// Integration test example
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function calculate(a, b) {
  return multiply(a, b) + sum(a, b);
}

test("calculates 2 * 3 + 2 + 3 to equal 11", () => {
  expect(calculate(2, 3)).toBe(11);
});

// End-to-end test example
describe("Math Solver", () => {
  it("should solve 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 2 to equal 12.5", () => {
    // ...
  });
});

/*
In this example, we have examples of different types of tests: a unit test for the sum function, an integration test for the calculate function that uses sum and multiply, and an end-to-end test for a math solver application that tests the behavior of the entire system.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
5. Unit Test Project

A unit test project involves writing tests for individual functions or modules in a software application or system. It is an important part of the development process and helps ensure that each component of the software works as intended.
*/

// Example:
// Function to test
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Test case
test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

/*
In this example, we have a simple unit test project that tests the sum function. We define a test case that expects the result of sum(2, 3) to be equal to 5. Running this test using Jest will verify that the sum function works correctly.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
6. Integration Test Project

An integration test project involves testing how different components of a software application or system work together. It helps ensure that the software as a whole works as intended.
*/

// Example:
// Functions to test
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function calculate(a, b) {
  return multiply(a, b) + sum(a, b);
}

// Test case
test("calculates 2 * 3 + 2 + 3 to equal 11", () => {
  expect(calculate(2, 3)).toBe(11);
});

/*
In this example, we have an integration test project that tests the calculate function, which depends on the multiply and sum functions. We define a test case that expects the result of calculate(2, 3) to be equal to 11. Running this test using Jest will verify that the calculate function works correctly.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
7. End To End Test Project

An end-to-end test project involves testing a complete software application or system from start to finish, including all user interactions and system integrations. It helps ensure that the software works as intended in a real-world environment.
*/

// Example:
describe("Math Solver", () => {
  it("should solve 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 2 to equal 12.5", () => {
    // ...
  });
});

/*
In this example, we have an end-to-end test project for a math solver application. We define a test case that tests the behavior of the entire system, by passing in a math expression and verifying that the result is correct.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
8. Test Drivin Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that involves writing tests before writing code. It helps ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and that bugs and defects are caught early in the development process.
*/

// Example:
// Function to test
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Test case
test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

/*
In Test Driven Development (TDD), you write tests before writing code. The goal is to write just enough code to make the tests pass, and then refactor the code to make it cleaner and more efficient. In this example, we start by defining a test case for the sum function, and then write the sum function to make the test pass.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
9. How To Know What To Test

Knowing what to test involves identifying the critical and complex parts of a software application or system that are most likely to have bugs or defects. This can be done through careful analysis of the software requirements and understanding the behavior of the software in different scenarios.
*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------
10. Jest With ES6 Modules

Jest has good support for ES6 modules, which are a modern way of organizing and importing code in JavaScript applications. This allows developers to write tests using the latest features of the language and take advantage of Jest's powerful testing features.
*/

// Example:
// math.js module
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// math.test.js module
import { sum, multiply } from "./math.js";

test("adds 2 + 3 to equal 5", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});

test("multiplies 2 * 3 to equal 6", () => {
  expect(multiply(2, 3)).toBe(6);
});

/*
Jest supports ES6 modules, which allow you to import and export functions between different files. In this example, we have a math.js module that exports sum and multiply functions, and a math.test.js module that imports these functions and defines test cases for them using Jest. When running tests using Jest, it will automatically transpile ES6 code to ES5 code using Babel.
*/
